**Github page and Swagger (Bluemix)**
Access it at [https://qdm12.github.io/Devops_RESTful/index.html](https://qdm12.github.io/Devops_RESTful/index.html).

## I - What is it?
- It is a RESTful API for a portfolio management.
- It uses many technologies: Python, Flask, Vagrant, Swagger, Redis, Docker, ...
- It can be run locally on a virtual machine with Vagrant or on Bluemix (IBM) remotely.
- The Redis database is stored on IBM Bluemix

## II - Access the API
- Access the root URL of the API on Bluemix at [https://portfoliomgmt.mybluemix.net](https://portfoliomgmt.mybluemix.net)
- Access the root URL of the API on the Bluemix container at [http://portfoliocontainer.mybluemix.net/](http://portfoliocontainer.mybluemix.net/)
- Access it on your virtual Vagrant machine at [localhost:5000](localhost:5000)
- The root URL uses **Swagger** to show a descriptive list of all available RESTful calls such as `POST`, `DELETE`, `PUT` and `GET`.

## III - Obtain the source code and minimum requirements
1. Install Vagrant from [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
2. Download the project
  - Without git
    - Download the ZIP file by clicking [here](https://github.com/qdm12/Devops_RESTful/archive/master.zip).
    - Extract the ZIP file.
  - With git (recommended)
    - Install git if you don't have it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or use `apt-get install git`.
    - Open a terminal and enter `git clone https://github.com/qdm12/Devops_RESTful.git`
3. Go to the project directory with a terminal with `cd Devops_RESTFUL`

## IV - Run it on your machine with Vagrant
1. Make sure to follow the steps of **III - Obtain the source code and minimum requirements**. 
2. Enter `vagrant up && vagrant ssh` (this will install the box, docker etc.)
3. Enter `python /vagrant/server.py` (in the virtual machine you just logged in)
4. Access the Python Flask server with your browser at [localhost:5000](localhost:5000). You can then make API calls with Swagger.
5. You can also use the Chrome extension `Postman` for example to send RESTful requests such as `POST`. Install it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en).
6. To update Swagger, refer to the information in the [Github `static` directory](https://github.com/qdm12/Devops_RESTful/tree/master/static).

## V - Run it on Bluemix
1. Make sure to follow the steps of **III - Obtain the source code and minimum requirements** although you don't need Vagrant.
2. Login to Bluemix as follows:
  - `cf login https://api.ng.bluemix.net -u username -o organization -s "Portfolio Management"`
  - Enter the API endpoint as `https://api.ng.bluemix.net`
  - Enter your password
3. Enter `cf push PortfolioMgmt`
4. You can then access it at [https://portfoliomgmt.mybluemix.net](https://portfoliomgmt.mybluemix.net)


## VI - Run it on a Docker container

### A) Build and run it on Vagrant
1. Make sure to follow the steps of **III - Obtain the source code and minimum requirements**. 
2. Enter `vagrant up && vagrant ssh` (this will install the box, docker etc.)
3. Enter `cd /vagrant` (in the virtual machine you just logged in)
4. Enter `docker build -t docker-portfoliomgmt .`
  - **Don't forget the '.' !**
  - This builds a Docker image `docker-portfoliomgmt` from the `Dockerfile` description file.
  - You can list your local Docker images with `docker images` to make sure it was created.
4. Run the Docker image with `docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 --link redis docker-portfoliomgmt`.
  - The `--rm` option automatically removes the container when it exits.
  - The `-p 5000:5000` option publishes the container's 5000 port to the host.
  - The `--link redis` option links the `docker-portfoliomgmt` to the `redis` container.
  - You can check the container is runnig with `docker ps -a`.
5. As for *IV*, you can access the Python Flask server with your browser at [localhost:5000](localhost:5000). You can then make API calls with Swagger.

### B) Push and run it on Bluemix
1. Make sure you had followed the steps of *A) Build and run it on Vagrant*.
2. In Vagrant (`vagrant up && vagrant ssh`), login in the bluemix server as follows:
  - `cf login https://api.ng.bluemix.net -u username -o organization -s "Portfolio Management"`
  - Enter the API endpoint as `https://api.ng.bluemix.net`
  - Enter your password
  - **TEMPORARY**: Enter `echo Y | cf install-plugin https://static-ice.ng.bluemix.net/ibm-containers-linux_x64` to install *cf ic*.
  - `cf ic login`
4. If not done already, create your namespace with `cf ic namespace set portfoliocontainer`
5. Tag the Docker image with the remote container name `registry.ng.bluemix.net/portfoliocontainer/devops-hw2` with the following command: `docker tag docker-portfoliomgmt registry.ng.bluemix.net/portfoliocontainer/devops-hw2`
6. Push it with `docker push registry.ng.bluemix.net/portfoliocontainer/devops-hw2`
7. The Docker image should be on the Bluemix webpage. Click on it to create a container.
8. Access the URL showing as *Routes* under *Group details* to access the running container. You can access it at [http://portfoliocontainer.mybluemix.net](http://portfoliocontainer.mybluemix.net)

## VII - Test driven development and PyUnit
1. If not on Vagrant, install **pip** and enter `pip install nose rednose coverage`
2. Run the server tests and find the test coverage with `nosetests --rednose -v --with-coverage --cover-package=server`
3. Or you can use `coverage run server_test.py && coverage report -m --include=server.py`

## VIII - Behavior driven development and behave
1. Turn vagrant on with `vagrant up && vagrant ssh`
2. Enter `cd /vagrant && behave` and check all the tests pass
